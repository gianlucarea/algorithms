#Â 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

# You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
# You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock 
# and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
# Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

# This solution finds the maximum profit from stock prices using a sliding window approach. 
# Time: O(n), Space: O(1). Efficiently tracks the lowest price and maximum profit in one pass.
